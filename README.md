# GuideIt
This is a solution to a coding exercise

I developed the project with the main purpose to show: 
* how I organize the project files and folders using **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**;
* Using the new features from Kotlin such as coroutines, extensions and so on;
* Using newest libraries from Jetpack such as JETPACK COMPOSE;
* I'm able to write unit tests to cover as much code as possible;
* I can write custom views old way with canvas and the new with jetpack compose composing a dsc;
* The project is divided by module
